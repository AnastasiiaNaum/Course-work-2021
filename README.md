In modern retail there are many characteristics that impact on product's final demand. The effect of promotion campaigns is evaluated as sales growth during promotion relatively to regular sales while product in promotion can reduce sales for similar products. This effect is called "product cannibalization".

Ignoring this effect leads to an incorrect assessment of promotional efficiency and reduces the commercial benefit for the retailer.

Under the project a corresponding economic model was studied, research on various approaches to building a model was made and the model for assessing sales of goods, taking into account the effect of cannibalization on Utkonos sales data was implemented.
